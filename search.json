Workout of the week This workout is awesome because you can do it anywhere. All you need is a floor. I’m pretty sure I do this at least once every time I travel. This is a 10 rep pyramid . Do each exercise 1 time, then 2 times, then 3 times, etc. Work up to 10 reps for each exercise, then go back down the pyramid with 9 reps, 8 reps, 7 reps, etc. You will finish the workout with a total of 100 reps for each exercise. Push-up Shoulder press If this seems like a bit too much right now, scale down the workout by choosing a smaller pyramid. You might surprise yourself. Take breaks as necessary, but go as fast as possible. @chrishunt: 7 minutes, 30 seconds "}]}
