This week I get my first <a href="{{ site.url }}/voicemail/">voicemail</a>,
explain why I do (and don't) use a standing desk, and I brush up on my math
skills to show why solving the Rubik's Cube will never be boring.

### Workout of the week

As fast as possible:

- 4 mile run

If you run a lot and that distance seems too short, you're not running fast
enough. If you hate running and 4 miles seems way too far, then you can try the
super popular [run-walk](http://www.jeffgalloway.com/training/run-walk/).

[**@chrishunt:**](https://twitter.com/chrishunt) 25 minutes, 40 seconds
