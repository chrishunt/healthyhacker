This week I talk about taking an adventure with a [stranger on the internet](https://twitter.com/r00k), what we learned, what we built, why we did it a second time, and why you might want to try it as well.

### Workout of the week

8 rounds (4 minutes) of:

- 20 seconds of [push-ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1IfJmVjKW0)
