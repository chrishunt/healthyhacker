What is financial planning? This week [Abraham
Martinez](https://www.briofg.com/team-member-01/abraham-martinez), financial
advisor and chief operating officer at [Brio
Financial](https://www.briofg.com), visits the show to explain his role as a
financial advisor and some of the tools and strategies he uses to help clients
reach their goals.

### Workout of the week

Grab some friends and [run a
fartlek](http://runners-resource.com/training/fartlek/) interval workout. If
you don't have any friends, it can be done alone as well.

Run hard for 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2 minutes, with a "rest" of 2:30 in between. This
can be done on a track, treadmill, or just outside as you run down the street.
It will look something like this:

- Run 2:00 minutes hard
- Run 2:30 easy
- Run 3:00 minutes hard
- Run 2:30 easy
- Run 4:00 minutes hard
- Run 2:30 easy
- ... (continue the rest of the cycle: 4, 3, 2)
