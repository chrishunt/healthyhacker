This week I'm going to answer a question that I get all the time: Why do I use Vim?

### Workout of the week

10 rep pyramid of:

- [Push-up](http://chrshnt.com/1s2CHTt)
- [Shoulder press](http://chrshnt.com/1nSotFE)

If you try this workout and die before you finish - sorry. Next time, try a
smaller pyramid. Take breaks as necessary, but go as fast as possible. You can
do it!
