This week Jeff Duncan, owner and trainer at [CrossFit Pearl District](http://crossfitpd.com), comes on the show to talk about CrossFit, how he started his gym, and why the program is different than any other fitness regimen you've tried.

### Workout of the week

This workout is fun because you can partition the exercises how ever you want.
I did all the running first, then finished by alternating between sit-ups and
push-ups.

As fast as possible:

- 2000 meter run
- 150 [sit-ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfqRSCgXiVw)
- 100 [push-ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1IfJmVjKW0)
