This week [Ben Orenstein](https://twitter.com/r00k) stops in Portland, Oregon during his 3 month "walkabout" to teach me how to sing a [barbershop tag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(barbershop_music)) and to share his thoughts on podcasting, conference talks, code review, and a few uncomfortable situations.
