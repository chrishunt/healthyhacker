This week I share what's great and not so great about working on a distributed team and the tricks I use to make the experience even better.

### Workout of the week

This workout comes from [CrossFit Pearl District](http://crossfitpd.com/2014/11/11-21-14-wod/). Decrease the number of repetitions as necessary. Somewhere between 5-10 reps each round would be awesome.

Every minute, on the minute, for 10 minutes:

- 10 [toes-to-bar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJZpz5C1dAA)
- 10 [push-ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1IfJmVjKW0)
