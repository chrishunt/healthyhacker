This week I talk about why I choose to use [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) for all
my text editing.

### Workout of the week

This workout is awesome because you can do it anywhere. All you need is a
floor.  I'm pretty sure I do this at least once every time I travel.

This is a **10 rep pyramid**. Do each exercise 1 time, then 2 times, then 3
times, etc.  Work up to 10 reps for each exercise, then go back down the
pyramid with 9 reps, 8 reps, 7 reps, etc. You will finish the workout with a
total of 100 reps for each exercise.

- [Shoulder press](http://www.google.com/images?q=shoulder+press)

If this seems like a bit too much right now, scale down the workout by choosing
a smaller pyramid. You might surprise yourself. Take breaks as necessary, but
go as fast as possible.
