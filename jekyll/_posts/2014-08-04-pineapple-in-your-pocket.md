This week I talk about something I'm super excited about: Memory. By the end of this episode, you will be able to quickly memorize a list of 10 things and understand how to take your memory even further.

### Workout of the week

Death by burpees! Remember - your phone probably has a stopwatch. If you want
to use audio queues (which I prefer), then try an interval timer like
[Seconds](http://www.secondsapp.com/).
