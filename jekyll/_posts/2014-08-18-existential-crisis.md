This week we get another <a href="{{ site.url }}/voicemail/">voicemail</a> and my brother Nick comes on the show to talk about deterministic multi-core processing, the CFP process for academic papers, how he transitioned from computer scientist to mountain guide, and everything you need to know to summit Mount Rainier.

### Workout of the week

5 rounds, as fast as possible:

- 50 [Mountain climbers](http://youtu.be/1J4hRICVjRo) (each leg)
- 25 [Sit-ups](http://youtu.be/EhG_x1bLHwE)
